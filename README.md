We are JHS Viking Robotics, FRC team 7221. Check us out on our [website](https://jhs-viking-robotics.com)!

## What Is This Page

This GitHub page is where we host all of our code and training resources. There is an official repository for each FRC season, one for our training resources, and some for fun experiments that we are working on.

If you don't know where to start, you should check out [Java-Hello-World](https://github.com/jhs-viking-robotics/java-hello-world) to get started with the tools we use. Then you should check out our most recent competition code and see what we've been working on!
